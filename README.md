# FreeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker Project

Welcome to the Exercise Tracker project! This project showcases how to use Express.js in full-stack JavaScript development to build an API for tracking exercises. The goal is to provide users with the ability to log their daily exercises with descriptions, durations, and dates, view detailed exercise logs, filter logs by date range, and control the number of logs returned with the limit parameter. Leveraging Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the Exercise Tracker offers users a seamless experience for managing and monitoring their fitness activities.
